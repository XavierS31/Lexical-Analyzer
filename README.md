# PL/0 Lexical Analyzer ‚Äî COP 3402 System Software

Lexical Analyzer implemented in **C** for the **PL/0 programming language**, developed as part of **COP 3402 ‚Äì System Software (Fall 2025)** at the University of Central Florida under **Dr. Jie Lin**.

This program reads a PL/0 source file, tokenizes its contents, and outputs three sections:
1. **Source Program** (verbatim copy)
2. **Lexeme Table** (token‚Äìtype mapping)
3. **Token List** (numeric representation)

## üìò Project Overview

This project implements the **first phase of a compiler**, known as **lexical analysis (scanning)**.

It performs:
- Character-by-character reading of a PL/0 program.
- Token recognition (identifiers, reserved words, numbers, symbols).
- Detection and reporting of lexical errors:
  - Identifiers longer than **11 characters**.
  - Numbers longer than **5 digits**.
  - Invalid symbols not part of the PL/0 alphabet.
- Skipping of comments (`/* ... */`) and whitespace.

The output format **exactly matches** the COP 3402 assignment specification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

‚úÖ Identifies and categorizes:
- **Reserved words** (`begin`, `end`, `if`, `then`, `var`, ‚Ä¶)
- **Identifiers** (up to 11 characters)
- **Numbers** (up to 5 digits)
- **Special symbols** (`+`, `-`, `:=`, `<`, `<=`, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, etc.)

‚ö†Ô∏è Reports lexical errors:
- `Identifier too long`
- `Number too long`
- `Invalid Symbol`

üß© Handles comments and whitespace:
- Skips multi-line comments: `/* comment */`
- Skips spaces, tabs, and newlines.
